If you need more time for an assignment that may be possible if

- you can explain the special circumstances that make you think that you should get more time for the assignment than the other students.

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture and participate in the [Discussion Forum](). 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.
