## Assignments

Programming assignments are part of the [assessment](assessment.md).

Each student should create a github repository for doing the assignments, see also the info on [github-best-pracitces.md].

The programming assignments
- can be done in groups of up to 3 students;
- must be submitted via a private GitHub repository shared with me (send me an email when you submit);
- are  typically due at 11:59 pm on the given date. 

For group assignments, only one of the students of the group needs to submit;

Moreover, 
- all programs must be tested.
- no points for programs that do not run.
- grading will be based on correctness, but elegance of solution and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.) are also taken into consideration

There will be the following assignments. Deadlines, links, instructions will be added in due course.

  - [Assignment 1](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SyzUgMabU): Searching Strings. Deadline Friday Feb 14, 11:59pm. 

  - **Assignment 2**: [Grammar and Parser for C++](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment1/assignment1.html). You can start from `bnfc/examples/cpp/cpp.cf`, see also [here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/Sources/Cpp/cpp.cf).  
    - Deadline for the first test file is Wed, March 11, (11:59 pm PST).
    - Deadline for the second part is Wed, March 18, (11:59 pm PST).
    - Deadline for the rest of the assignment Wed, March 25, (11:59 pm PST).
    - This assignment is a great opportunity to practice proper use of git. Provide a full trail of your work under git. In particular, each time your parser parses successfully a new testfile, it is time to make sure that this grammar is pushed to git. You can then create a new branch to work on the new version of the grammar and merge it back to master when it passes the new test-file. Branches also allow you to work in a group on different versions of the grammar at the same time.
    - Use git to share your current version of the grammar with me if you want to ask me a question.
