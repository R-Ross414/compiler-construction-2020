# Test 2

## Rules

- You have 60 minutes.
- I only accept hand written solutions.
- Take a picture when you are finished and send it to me via email by [clicking on this link]((mailto:akurz@chapman.edu?subject=Compiler-Construction-Test-2)).
- **No communication between yourself** or with other people. You have to work alone. If I suspect plagiarism, I will have to move on to more difficult, open-ended questions for tests and finals.
- You can use all your notes, run bnfc, run a C++ compiler.
