### Part 2: Parsing

- **Lecture 4.1**: **How to build an interpreter in one lecture**. Chapter 2.1 - 2.6 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). For installation  introductions see the [BNFC homepage](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com) or our own [BNFC installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md). *Homework* (mandatory): 
  - Install Haskell and BNFC following the [BNFC installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md) and get the calculator running. *Deadline: Monday, March 2* (we need this Tuesday in class). 
  - Read the [BNFC tutorial](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/tutorial/bnfc-tutorial.html) or the [short version](bnfc-tutorial-short.md) which contains what we covered in the lecture.
  - Convince yourself that the grammar in `Calc.cf` has only one parse tree for `1+2*3`.

- **Lecture 4.2**: **How to use a grammar for debugging a program**. Exercise 2 in  [BNFC self check](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/BNFC-example.md). *Homework* (mandatory): Find the bug in the program of [Exercise 2](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/BNFC-example.md). *Homework* (optional): Study the grammar of a language you know, for example [C](https://cs.wmich.edu/~gupta/teaching/cs4850/sumII06/The%20syntax%20of%20C%20in%20Backus-Naur%20form.htm) or [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-19.html).


- **Lecture 5.1**:  **How to build a grammar**. We explain how one can come up with the grammar of C-- of the [BNFC tutorial](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/tutorial/bnfc-tutorial.html), see [here](bnfc-tutorial-C--.md) for a short version of the tutorial. *Homework* (mandatory): Play around with changing the grammar of C-- (and possibly the program). Post your findings on the discussion group.

  - *Homework* (mandatory): Do the exercises from the lecture notes. These exercises are relevant for tests and final.
  - *Homework* (optional): Study ParCalc.info and understand how it describes a determinstic algorithm.

- **6.1:** Test 1. 

- **Assignment 2**: [Grammar and Parser for C++](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment1/assignment1.html). You can start from `bnfc/examples/cpp/cpp.cf`, see also [here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/Sources/Cpp/cpp.cf).  
  - Deadline for the first test file is Wed, March 11, (11:59 pm PST).
  - Deadline for the second part is Wed, March 18, (11:59 pm PST).
  - Deadline for the rest of the assignment Wed, March 25, (11:59 pm PST).
  - This assignment is a great opportunity to practice proper use of git. Provide a full trail of your work under git. In particular, each time your parser parses successfully a new testfile, it is time to make sure that this grammar is pushed to git. You can then create a new branch to work on the new version of the grammar and merge it back to master when it passes the new test-file. Branches also allow you to work in a group on different versions of the grammar at the same time.
  - Use git to share your current version of the grammar with me if you want to ask me a question.

- [Lecture 6.2](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJx6T5R48): Shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts. *Homework:* Do the exercise from the lecture notes. These exercises are relevant for Assignment 2.

- Lecture 7.1: We spent most of the time discussing the benign shift-reduce conflict known as **[dangling else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else)** (good Wikepedia article). We wrote out some (improvised) grammar rules such as

      Exp ::= ExpIf | ExpIfElse | C | D | ...
      ExpBool ::= A | B | ...
      ExpIf ::= "if" ExpBool "then" Exp 
      ExpIfElse ::= "if" ExpBool "then" Exp "else" Exp 

  and analysed how a shift-reduce parser would parse
  
      if A then if B then C else D

  (Note that in the grammar we chose to make if-then-else an expression, not a statement, as, for example, in [F#](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/expressions-vs-statements/) or the language  LambdaNat we have seen last semester in Programming Languages.)

- [Lecture 7.2](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SkXrrBuSI): How to debug a grammar? We spent most of the time on Examples 1 and 2.

- [Bonus lecture](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJ4sbGyrU): As this question came up in class, for those who are interested, I worked out a detailed example showing how the LALR(1) parser generated by BNFC and Happy works.


## Part 3: Type Checking

**Stocktaking:** We have covered the first three chapters of the book [Implementing Programming Languages](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). This could be a good time to read through these chapters to consolidate what we learned. 

We will now turn to Chapter 4 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).

Reasons why type checking is important:

- The copy language is not context free.
- Compile-time errors are cheaper than run-time errors.
- Information in the types can be used to produce more efficient code.
- Types can be used to disambiguate over-loaded operations.

For us there is another one, namely that type checking can be seen as a poor cousin of interpretation (only finitely many values and all inputs known at compile time). Everything we learn about typechecking will help us to understand interpretation better.

- **Lecture 8.1**: Working towards Assignment 3, the [Type Checker for CPP](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment2/assignment2.html). Main source is Chapter 4 of the book. *Homework:* Read Chapter 3.9 to 4.3 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf) and be prepared to ask any questions that you might have on this at the beginning of the next lecture. Read the rest of Chapter 4 to prepare for the next lecture.

- **Lecture 8.2**: Working towards Assignment 3. For general background, we need the [Grammar](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/examples/CPP.cf) and understand how programs are translated into abstract syntax. We went through [Slides](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/slides/4-slides-ipl-book.pdf), up to page 15. *Homework:* Run (a program with) the expression `x+y>y` through your bnfc generated parser and study the abstract syntax tree. Can you write out the steps that the typchecker takes for a similar but different example?

- **Lecture 9.1**: Assignment 3. We looked how to do typechecking rules for the statements of the [grammar](Sources/CPP/CPP.cf) and went through the [slides](Sources/4-slides-ipl-book.pdf), up to page 34. 

- **9.2** was Test 2.

- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/README.md). Deadlines April 13, April 20.

- **Lecture 10.1:** We looked through the code of the [typechecker](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/Typechecker/Haskell/src/TypeChecker.hs) with the aim of understanding to match up the typchecking rules in the [slides](Sources/4-slides-ipl-book.pdf) with the code. See also the notes on tips on Haskell linked from the README of Assignment 3. *Homework:* Read Chapter 4 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).

- **Lecture 10.2:** The recorded lecture from the afternoon session contains a detailed discussion of how to write the code for typechecking function calls.


## Part 4: Interpretation

- **[Assignment 4](assignments.md)**: Deadlines April 22 and 29.

- **Lecture 11.1:**  Interpretation is similar to typechecking in many ways. In fact, we can think of type checking as the part of interpretation (or, should we say, evaluation) that can be done at compile time. This is the topic of Chapter 5 of the book, see also the [slides](Sources/5-slides-ipl-book.pdf). In this lecture we looked at expressions, in the next lecture we will look at statements. *Homework:* Chapter 5.1-5.2 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf) is essential reading.

- **Lecture 11.2:**  Resources: IPL, [Chapter 5](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf) and the [slides](Sources/5-slides-ipl-book.pdf) and the grammar [cpp.cf](Sources/Cpp/cpp.cf) and the interpreter template [Interpreter.hs](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/Interpreter/Haskell/src/Interpreter.hs). 
**Homework:** Chapter 5.3-5.6 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf) is essential reading. Read Chapter 5.7 together with the template file `Interpreter.hs` and note that some of our naming conventions are slighly different. Read Chapter 5.8 as an outlook on the JVM.


## Part 5: Code Generation

- **[Assignment 4](assignments.md)**: Deadlines May 1 and May 10.

- **[Lecture 12.1](lecture-12.1.md)**: Webassembly.
